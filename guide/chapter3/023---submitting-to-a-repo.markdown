The repos have pretty straight forward submission links/processes so each website will have details on how to submit to it. If you ae unsure about something you will always be able to email the owners.

[MyRepoSpace](https://www.myrepospace.com/) - If you want a private repo where you can manage everything by yourself, good for beta testing.  
[BigBoss](http://www.thebigboss.org) - Is a default repo.  
[ModMyi](http://www.modmyi.com) - Is also a default repo, although I don't have much experience with hosting here it seems as good as BigBoss.
