.. will be called "**SliderChanger**" and it will be a tweak that changes the text of the lockscreen slider. Yes this has been done before but it is rather easy and a good get-started project.

This chapter will guide you through setting up the project, finding the relevant classes, hooking into them to change them, setting up/using a preference-pane (settings) and lastly some info about submitting a tweak to an official repo. This chapter will not go into any depths and should be mainly be used as a way for you to get started with as little friction as possible.

Let's go.
