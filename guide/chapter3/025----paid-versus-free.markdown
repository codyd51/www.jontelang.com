**Paid tweaks** can take up to a week, usually 5 days. To submit a paid tweak you will need (BigBoss experience now) to sign some form (digitally is fine) which takes some day(s) to process. You will also need a [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com) account. After submitting a paid tweak you will get links to a basic management website where you can do some things.

**Free tweaks** takes maybe 1-2 days from the submission process to appear in Cydia.
