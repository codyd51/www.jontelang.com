Your tweak has an identifier, in this case it is `com.jontelang.sliderchanger`. If you do not own the domain (again, this case) "jontelang.com" the repo will change the tweak identifier to e.g. `org.bigboss.sliderchanger`. This can be important if you are doing something in regards to piracy-checks which relies on the identifiers (more on this later). 

If you do own the domain in question, tell this to the repo managers so that they can avoid changing it.
