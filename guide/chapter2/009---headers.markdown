You can get some headers from [github](http://www.github.com). For iOS 6 I've had great times with [these](https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers). I just keep these in some random directory and use them as a manual "dictionary" where I search trhough them.

You should put your headers in the directory `/opt/theos/include/`. I do not remember where I got mine (this was over a year ago) but through some trail and error I managed to get a compiling setup. I am using [these headers](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6084360/include.zip).
