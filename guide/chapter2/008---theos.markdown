Download _theos_ from DHowetts [github repo](https://github.com/DHowett/theos) and unzip it to `/opt/theos/` (You may have to create this folder).

> NOTE: The location is not actually important but it makes it easier for me to write this.

To verify that it works open your `terminal` and write `/opt/theos/bin/nic.pl`, this should show you a menu like this.

You can exit out of this with `CTRL + C` (OSX Terminal).
